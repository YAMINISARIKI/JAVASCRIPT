			let c=30;
			document.write(c);
		}*/

		//document.write(c); //it will give error because elements declred inside the block won't be returned whrn it is written outside the block.

		//3. const  

		//--> when we declare a variable using 'const' , it's value won't be changed ...it will be constant. just like atm card number -->they are unique then it will be declared using 'const'. ex: id card numbers

		const atmcardno = 1234567;
		// atmcardno=111 //error will be generated because it cannot be reinitialized.
		document.write(atmcardno);
